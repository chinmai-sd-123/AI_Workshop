# AI_Workshop
Hands-on workshop on Generative AI and Agentic AI featuring 3 collaborative projects and 1 individual project. Focused on integrating generative models with autonomous agents, the workshop combined theory with practical implementation. This repo contains code, docs, and resources.
This repository contains the outcomes of a workshop focused on Generative AI and Agentic AI. The workshop aimed to provide participants with both conceptual understanding and practical exposure to building AI-driven applications.

Objectives

Introduce fundamentals of Generative AI and Agentic AI.

Explore real-world applications through guided projects.

Encourage collaborative and independent problem-solving.

Projects Developed

Group Projects (3):

Project 1 – Demonstrated application of Generative AI for content creation.

Project 2 – Implemented agentic decision-making for task automation.

Project 3 – Combined generative models with autonomous agents to solve a real-world use case.

Individual Project (1):

Each participant was assigned a project to independently apply workshop learnings, promoting innovation and deeper technical exploration.

Outcomes

Practical experience in integrating Generative and Agentic AI.

Improved understanding of autonomous agents and generative models.

Development of both collaborative and individual problem-solving skills.

Repository of project implementations and resources for further learning.
